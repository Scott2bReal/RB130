## Closures, Binding, and scope

### What is a closure?

  A closure in Ruby is a chunk of code that can be saved, passed around as an
  object, and executed. Three main ways of creating a closure in Ruby are
  through the use of blocks, procs, and lambdas.

### What is binding?
  
  When a closure is created, all of the objects, variables and methods
  (artifacts) which are in-scope are saved with the closure. These surrounding
  artifacts are called a closure's "binding"
